# SQL-Project
The project was based on a dummy pet grooming business case scenario.
The business case was built identifying customer information, internal operations, sales, services, employee information etc.
A database was built and the ER diagram explains the database schema in BCNF.
All dependencies were assessed and removed and tables were normalized to BCNF
The project contains business querying and SQL joins that were used to extract meaningful relatoionships and information from the databases
in order to improve business operational efficiency.
